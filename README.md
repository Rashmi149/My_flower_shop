🌸 Blooming Creativity with Code! 🌸



I’m beyond excited to share my latest HTML & CSS practice project—a flower shop website! 💻💐
It’s not just a website; it’s a vibrant garden of code where I’ve brought design, structure, and a sprinkle of passion to life.

What makes this special?

Designed for laptop view only (for now 😉).
A testament to the hours of learning and experimenting.
Proof that every project—no matter how small—is a step toward growth!
This project is far from perfect, but it’s mine, and I’m proud of the progress it represents. If you’re also on your coding journey, remember: every line of code is a flower in your growing garden of skills. 🌼

What’s next?
I’m working on making it fully responsive (mobile users, your time will come!), and I can’t wait to see it bloom even more.

Let me know your thoughts or suggestions! 🚀 And if you’re on your own learning path, drop a comment—I’d love to connect and exchange ideas!
